title: Making sense of Tuxedo's SCANUNIT, SANITYSCAN, and BLOCKTIME
tags: oracle tuxedo scanunit blocktime sanityscan

Time accounting is strange in Oracle Tuxedo. First, there is the `SCANUNIT` parameter which must be a value between `0` and `60` seconds and also a multiple of `2` or `5` (`10` by default). Then the `SANITYSCAN` to perform system health checks and `BLOCKTIME` for blocking timeouts are expressed as the multipliers of that `SCANUNIT`. One of the side-effects of that is timeouts are rarely exact. Most often they are off by up to `SCANUNIT` seconds.

That was one of the design decisions that made no sense for me until I understood how it is implemented. Health checks and blocking timeouts are implemented by the `BBL` server. We can see how it works by tracing the system calls:

```bash
strace -p `pidof BBL`
msgrcv(32769, 0x1fdc038, 4712, -1073741824, 0) = ? ERESTARTNOHAND (To be restarted if no handler)
--- SIGALRM {si_signo=SIGALRM, si_code=SI_KERNEL} ---
alarm(10)                               = 0
rt_sigreturn({mask=[]})                 = -1 EINTR (Interrupted system call)
alarm(0)                                = 10
stat("/etc/localtime", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=127, ...}) = 0
semop(0, [{0, -1, SEM_UNDO}], 1)        = 0
semop(0, [{0, 1, SEM_UNDO}], 1)         = 0
rt_sigaction(SIGALRM, {sa_handler=0x4106fd, sa_mask=[], sa_flags=SA_RESTORER, sa_restorer=0x7f5d921ecb30}, NULL, 8) = 0
alarm(10)                               = 0
msgrcv(32769, 0x1fdc038, 4712, -1073741824, 0) = ? ERESTARTNOHAND (To be restarted if no handler)
--- SIGALRM {si_signo=SIGALRM, si_code=SI_KERNEL} ---
alarm(10)                               = 0
rt_sigreturn({mask=[]})                 = -1 EINTR (Interrupted system call)
alarm(0)                                = 10
stat("/etc/localtime", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=127, ...}) = 0
semop(0, [{0, -1, SEM_UNDO}], 1)        = 0
semop(0, [{0, 1, SEM_UNDO}], 1)         = 0
rt_sigaction(SIGALRM, {sa_handler=0x4106fd, sa_mask=[], sa_flags=SA_RESTORER, sa_restorer=0x7f5d921ecb30}, NULL, 8) = 0
alarm(10)                               = 0
msgrcv(32769, 0x1fdc038, 4712, -1073741824, 0) = ? ERESTARTNOHAND (To be restarted if no handler)
--- SIGALRM {si_signo=SIGALRM, si_code=SI_KERNEL} ---
```

So the `BBL` server is using old-school multi-tasking. It is waiting for incoming service requests on the request queue (`msgrcv` system call) for the `.TMIB` service. But before doing so, it sets up the timer using `alarm(10)` which will deliver the `SIGALRM` to the process in 10 seconds. And `10` is the value of `SCANUNIT` in this case. Every time `SIGALRM` is delivered to the `BBL` process, it checks for blocking timeouts, and once in a while checks if server processes are still alive by calling `kill` with a signal equal to `0`.

[Oracle Tuxedo 12c Release 1 (12.1.1)](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E35855_01/tuxedo/docs12c/relnotes/relnotes.html) introduced millisecond granularity for `SCANUNIT`. Adding the `MS` suffix to the value allows specifying a `SCANUNIT` between 0 and 30,000 milliseconds. It means that crashed servers can be restarted faster and timeouts have greater accuracy. But the algorithm stays the same. Instead of using the `alarm` function call the `setitimer` function call is used, but that is the only difference.
