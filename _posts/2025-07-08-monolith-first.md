Many go to Martin Fowler for microservice architecture, distributed systems, micro frontends, event sourcing, and other fancy ideas about architecture, but [a few have noticed the advice to do a monolith first](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html):

> As I hear stories about teams using a microservices architecture, I've noticed a common pattern.
> 1. Almost all the successful microservice stories have started with a monolith that got too big and was broken up
> 2. Almost all the cases where I've heard of a system that was built as a microservice system from scratch, it has ended up in serious trouble.
>
> This pattern has led many of my colleagues to argue that **you shouldn't start a new project with microservices, even if you're sure your application will be big enough to make it worthwhile.**
