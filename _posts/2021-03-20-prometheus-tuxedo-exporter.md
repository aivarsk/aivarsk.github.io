title: A Prometheus exporter of Tuxedo metrics
---

Now that [my book about Oracle Tuxedo](https://amzn.to/3ljktiH) is completed, I can work on some code that did not make it into the book. Here is the first by-product: [a Prometheus exporter of Tuxedo metrics](https://pypi.org/project/prometheus-tuxedo-exporter/). Chapter 6 (among other topics) showed how to retrieve statistics from the Tuxedo core system, but there was no space to include export to Application Performance Management tool.
