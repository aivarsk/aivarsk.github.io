title: Changing model of time and space
---

[The morning paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/09/13/data-on-the-outside-versus-data-on-the-inside/) today has this epic piece that I'll save here:

> >  Going to microservices is like going from Newton’s physics to Einstein’s physics. Newton’s time marched forward uniformly with instant knowledge at a distance. Before microservices, distributed computing strove to make many systems look like one with RPC, 2PC etc.. In Einstein’s universe, everything is relative to one’s perspective. Microservices has “now” inside (a service) and the “past” arriving in messages.

> Perhaps we should rename the “extract microservice” refactoring operation to “change model of time and space”😉.
