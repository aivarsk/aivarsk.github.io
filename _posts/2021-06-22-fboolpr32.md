I described the `SIGFPE` bomb of [Boolean Expressions](http://aivarsk.com/2021/05/14/fboolev32/) before. Going through the list of the C functions I was reminded of the `Fboolpr32` function that prints the expression tree as it was parsed. Ten minutes later I had added it to the [Python Tuxedo library](https://pypi.org/project/tuxedo/). So let us look at the `SIGFPE` bomb again:

```python
>>> import tuxedo as t
>>> t.Fboolev32({"TA_STATUS": "OK123"}, "TA_STATUS %! 'OK.*'")
Floating-point exception
```

Now we can investigate and verify how it was parsed by Oracle Tuxedo:

```python
>>> t.Fboolpr32("TA_STATUS %! 'OK.*'", sys.stdout)
( ( TA_STATUS[0] ) % ( ! ( 'OK.*' ) ) )
```

Indeed, it is interpreted as the `%` modulo operation and `!` negation. And here is what the developer intended to write:

```python
>>> t.Fboolpr32("TA_STATUS !% 'OK.*'", sys.stdout)
( ( TA_STATUS[0] ) !% ( 'OK.*' ) )
```

P.S. I have even implemented the `Fboolpr32` function for [my Open Source replacement of Oracle Tuxedo](https://github.com/fuxedo/fuxedo/blob/master/src/expr.cpp#L428)
