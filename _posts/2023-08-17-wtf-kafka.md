title: Today I Learned... WTF, Kafka?
tags: kafka POLA

I was reading about [offset retention](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-186%3A+Increase+offsets+retention+default+to+7+days) and was mentally prepared for losing consumer offsets when the consumer has been offline for 7+ days. But I realized that it's 7+ days since the last update of offsets. This means if a topic did not receive any new message for 7+ days, there is no reason to update the offsets and they will be lost as well.

WTF, Kafka? How about the [Principle of least astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment)?

It's So Over.

Ok, ok. We had [changes for consumer groups](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-211%3A+Revise+Expiration+Semantics+of+Consumer+Group+Offsets) but not the simple consumers. Then we had [updates for consumer groups](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-496%3A+Administrative+API+to+delete+consumer+offsets) to delete *some* offsets. Which lead to [a bug during rebalance](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13636) that made my brain spin for almost a month.
