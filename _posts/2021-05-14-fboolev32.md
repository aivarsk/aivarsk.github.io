Oracle Tuxedo has the `Fboolev32` function for evaluating Boolean expressions in which the "variables" are the values of fields. The expressions are a subset of the C programming language with a nice addition of _regular expression match_ operators:

- _expression %% expression_ yields a 1 if the first expression is fully matched by the second expression (the regular expression).
- _expression !% expression_ yields a 1 if the first expression is not matched by the second expression.

Since expressions do not have a subscript operator for strings, regular expressions are used to match the prefix, postfix, or the nth character:

```python
import tuxedo as t
t.Fboolev32({"TA_STATUS": "OK123"}, "TA_STATUS %% 'OK.*'")
```

These operators are something new to most developers and sometimes you get expressions like this one:

```python
import tuxedo as t
t.Fboolev32({"TA_STATUS": "OK123"}, "TA_STATUS %! 'OK.*'")
```

What will be the result? A crash of your process!

Instead of the `!%` operator, the developer typed in `%!` which is parsed as two operators:

- `%` for the modulo operation
- `!` for negation

What happens next is:

- `'OK.*'` is a non-empty string and evaluates to 1
- `!` negates 1 and evaluates to 0
- `TA_STATUS` is converted to a number, most likely a 0. But it does not matter
- `0 % 0` is division by 0 and we get a `SIGFPE` signal deliver to the process

Most of the software out there does not have a `SIGFPE` signal handler installed and crash:

```python
>>> import tuxedo as t
>>> t.Fboolev32({"TA_STATUS": "OK123"}, "TA_STATUS %! 'OK.*'")
Floating-point exception
```

Now image if those Boolean expressions were written by the user... If you use Boolean expressions in your Oracle Tuxedo application, remember to install the `SIGFPE` handler.
