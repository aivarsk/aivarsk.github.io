My name is Aivars Kalvans. I wrote software (C, C++ and Python) that runs on Oracle Database and Tuxedo for more than 18 years. I tinker with internals of Oracle and various other software and develop [an Open Source alternative to Oracle Tuxedo](https://github.com/fuxedo/fuxedo) called [Fuxedo](http://fuxedo.io).

I have written a book about developing modern Oracle Tuxedo applications using Python. I also conduct Oracle Tuxedo training for developers and administrators, contact me for more information.

Some other code I have written both bad and "good enough":

- [Scruffy UML](https://github.com/aivarsk/scruffy) - creates UML diagrams from textual description.
- [libvmod-rewrite](https://github.com/aivarsk/libvmod-rewrite) - a plugin for Varnish (proxy server) that allows to modify cached pages.
- [pattern-matcher](https://github.com/aivarsk/pattern-matcher) and [cloud-instances](https://github.com/aivarsk/cloud-instances) are winning entries of Latvia Java User Group programming contest. The first one was written while I was still drunk after a party.
- [Scrapy proxies](https://github.com/aivarsk/scrapy-proxies) - Scrapy (web scraping framework) extension for using random proxies. Some people find it useful.
